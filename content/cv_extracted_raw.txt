Summary
Senior Data Scientist experienced in Tabular, NLP, and CV, with
proven work in both utilities (ESO) and public registries (Registrų
centras). I apply AI to automate business processes—ranging
from Mass Outage Forecasting, contractor documentation quality
assessment (NLP), and CV-based network data validation, to
Document AI solutions for large-scale document ingestion, text
extraction, structured information extraction via prompt engineering,
and quality/error detection.
My skills are complemented by certifications in Generative AI with
Large Language Models, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
Experience
Registrų centras
Senior Data Scientist
October 2024 - Present (1 year 5 months)
Vilnius, Vilniaus, Lithuania
The primary responsibility involves utilizing Artificial Intelligence algorithms to
automate various document processing workflows.
LLM:
- Lead end-to-end LLM initiatives for document understanding and workflow
automation;
- Design and maintain ingestion pipelines for multi-format documents (PDF,
DOCX, scanned images, archive containers);
- Build extraction workflows that transform unstructured text into structured
JSON outputs for downstream systems;
- Develop prompt engineering standards, deterministic normalization rules, and
schema-based validation logic;
- Run continuous evaluation loops (error analysis, mismatch review, regression
checks) and improve extraction quality iteratively;

- Implement human-in-the-loop controls so specialists retain final decision
authority while AI accelerates initial assessment and preparation.
ML:
- Develop and operate classical ML pipelines for business process automation
and decision support;
- Build supervised models for document/email classification, relevance
detection, and request-type routing;
- Own the full lifecycle: dataset preparation, feature/label pipeline design,
training, validation, and production-quality monitoring;
- Improve model robustness through structured error analysis, and retraining
cycles.
- Translate model outputs into actionable operational recommendations for
business teams.
